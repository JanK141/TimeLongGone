## Backstory
This project started as a school project on Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology, but quickly became a passion and a great learning experience. We started the project in early 2022 with 2 main motivations: to learn how to develop a game from start to finish by ourselfs, and to give free reign to our creativity.

## About the game
Time Long Gone is a isometric view boss battle arena game stylized on flat-shaded low-poly look, in which you play as a long forgotten master of the sword with time bending magic, that he uses to defeat different furious spirits ravaging the lands.
